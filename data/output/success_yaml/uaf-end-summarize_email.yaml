    message: >
      0107The financial processing portion of the (PRD)  nightly batch for today, %%$DATE, has completed at %%TIME.00000071That means that the following jobs streams have all finished executing:0019Archibus Processing0023Core Accounting Segment0024PCard Processing Segment0032eInvoice and SciQuest processing0035Bank Transaction Processing Segment00000298If any special schedules, such as Month End or Annual processing ran, those were not explicity accounted for in this email, but if they failed to compelete then one of the above segments would not have completed, and you would not have received this email. So, this implies that they too completed.00000294The overall nightly batch should still be checked. Some jobs are designed to continue, even upon a KFS batch job failure status. However, by receiving this email it does imply that the Nightly Batch did fully execute and that no criical jobs have failed (those that do not continue on failure).00000248Following this email, there are some Control-M jobs remaining, including system cleanup jobs and those jobs that restore user access. Once you receve an email that user access has been restored, the Nightly Batch for this evening is fully complete.00000015---------------0014%%$DATE.%%TIME0009KFS-IND-NBISGDS
