  report:
    subject: %%ENV - KFS-CFD-CFDAE - CFDA reminder
    message: >
      %%$DATE %%TIME - The CFDA update process has been completed.
      
      Any existing CFDA values that were in the system prior to the execution of the
      process would not have been automatically updated due to the manual setting
      that is in place. Although, as a reminder, there may have been new CFDA values
      added to the system as a result of the process. These new values must have the
      maintenance type flag set to MANUAL in the system or the next time the process
      is ran, the process will automatically update these values.
      
      Reminder:
      
      CFDA values can be found in the following location in KFS:
      
      Maintenance Tab --> Contracts & Grants --> CFDA
